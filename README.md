# Machine-Learning-approach-for-Malware-Detection
A Machine Learning approach for classifying a file as Malicious or Legitimate.

This approach tries out 6 different classification algorithms before deciding which one to use for prediction by comparing their results.
Different Machine Learning models tried are, Linear Regression, RandomForest, DecisionTree,  Adaboost, Gaussian, Gradient Boosting.

In order to test the model on an unseen file, it's required to extract the characteristics of the given file. Python's pefile.PE library is used to construct and build the feature vector and a ML model is used to predict the class for the given file based on the already trained model. 

# Steps to Run the model in cmd
The executable part in the ipynb file can be copied and saved as py file after the creation of classifier.pkl and features.pkl.
Then while running the program the file to be tested if malicious or legitimate can be given as system argument in the cmd.
eg : python malware.py file..

Dependencies
